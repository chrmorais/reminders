* When user changes reminder's times, scheduled updates should be rescheduled;
* Add sound to notifications;
* Add language selection;
* Display generic reminder when there's no connection or when meal is unavailable.
* Check date of meal before reminding; (really necessary? looks so, there are weekends and holidays)
* Listen for change in connectivity after error;
* Regular expressions support.

* Looks like a bug: sometimes says that meal has been updated but display lunch's meal instead of dinner's.
