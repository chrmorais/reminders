In Progress
=========================
* I'm still fixing the application's flow, MainIntentService has been broken down into 3 services;
* Updates looks to be working, but I don't trust this AlarmManager class;
* Putting notifications up again;
* OS does kill application and services, using AlarmManager to let the system manage next update and notifications.

Next
=========================
* Start to work on the notifications per word;
* Will look how Content Providers work, to use with the content retrieved from the website;
* Build some fake pages to test.

Future
=========================
* Support for Limeira's campus will be added.
