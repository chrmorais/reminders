Reminders
=========
This software is intended for students from UNICAMP as a simple reminder of the daily meal.
In portuguese "Lembretes"

It connects to the webpage of the university's restaurant to retrieve the meal and according to user preferences, it reminds him.

There are two kinds of reminders:

1. per meal -> twice a day, before each meal, the application will remind the user.
2. per word -> before each meal, the application will look up if any of the words given by the user is present, if so the application will remind the user.

Requirements
------------
Minimum Android 2.1 API 7 (tested).

Usage
-----
On first run the settings screen is displayed for further configuration.
That's it, no additional steps are required, the application will (or not, if disabled by user) reminder the user based on the configurations.
