This software is intended for students from UNICAMP as a simple reminder of the daily meal.
In portuguese "Lembretes"

It connects to the webpage of the university's restaurant to retrieve the meal and according to user preferences, it reminds him.

Requirements
------------
Not sure, I've developed the app with minimum API 16, but I use a device with API 22 and I won't be testing on older APIs anymore.

Usage
-----
The user should run the app at least once to initialize stuff, then the app reminds the user according to preferences.
